**I am Developer at heart, currently working as Principal Customer Engineer at [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)**

Working with different customers across Nordics, helping them to make best use of Cloud native technologies and accelerate 
their journey to cloud. In my spare time, I enjoy running into the woods and love to learn new technical skills. 
I am quite passionate about DevOps and serverless technologies in general.
