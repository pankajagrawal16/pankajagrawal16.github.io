## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I am Developer at heart, working as Senior Solutions Architect, [Amazon web services](https://aws.amazon.com/).** 

Currently, working with different customers across Nordics, helping them to make best use of AWS services and accelerate 
their journey to cloud. In my spare time, I enjoy running into the woods and love to learn new technical skills. 
I am quite passionate about DevOps and serverless technologies in general.
